# Install module

- Module will work only on Powershell 7
- To install module clone this repository
- Copy Folder `WorkMadeEasy` to the path `C:\Users\%username%\Documents\PowerShell\Modules`
- If you want module to be available system wide, copy folder `WorkMadeEasy` to `C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\Modules`
- Since the module is not signed, you are going to have to manually unblock both files
